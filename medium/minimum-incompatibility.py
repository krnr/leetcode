"""
You are given an integer array _nums_ and an integer _k_. You are asked to
distribute this array into k subsets of equal size such that there are no two
equal elements in the same subset.

A subset's incompatibility is the difference between the maximum and minimum
elements in that array.

Return the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities of the k subsets after
distributing the array optimally, or return -1 if it is not possible.

A subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.

Â 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,4], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2] and [1,4].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (4-1) = 4.
Note that [1,1] and [2,4] would result in a smaller sum, but the first subset contains 2 equal elements.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,3,8,1,3,1,2,2], k = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal distribution of subsets is [1,2], [2,3], [6,8], and [1,3].
The incompatibility is (2-1) + (3-2) + (8-6) + (3-1) = 6.
